# Cybersecurity Threat Analysis (2015–2024) 🔐

## 📊 Overview
This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to cybersecurity incident data to identify behavioral anomalies, detect rare attack patterns, and visualize global cyber threats from 2015–2024. We used Python, SQL, and Power BI to carry out end-to-end analysis, from preprocessing to reporting.

## ✅ Project Workflow

### PHASE 1: Preprocessing & EDA
- Cleaned data (missing values, types, duplicates)
- Visualized: top attack types, financial loss, country heatmap, industry trends

### PHASE 2: SQL Integration
- Designed schema and imported into MySQL
- Queried top industries by loss, rare sources, avg resolution time

### PHASE 3: Anomaly Detection Models
| Model             | Use Case                             | Tool         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| Isolation Forest | Outlier detection                     | PyOD         |
| One-Class SVM    | Behavioral deviation                  | Scikit-learn |
| KMeans Clustering| Behavioral grouping                   | Scikit-learn |

### PHASE 4: Power BI Dashboard
- KPI Cards, Line Chart, Bar Chart, Map, Pie Chart, Gauge
- Showed trends, risk areas, and severity of incidents

### PHASE 5: Reporting
- Answered: Most harmful attacks, industry risk, anomaly patterns, country trends
